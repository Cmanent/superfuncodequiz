DESCRIPTION OF TASK

As a coding student I wish to create a timed quiz about a topic I like, with some cool css. I will create a timer with alerts and a scoring system to tell the user how they faired. I want to make this fun, so I will be throwing out some trick questions! I will also be using the Bootstrap framework to make the page responsive and user friendly on any interface. My goal is to create a fun and simple quiz to the best of my current abilities and time constraint. 


EXECUTION OF TASK

I wrote a quiz about plant based nutrition because I love the topic and love to educate others on it. I feel I found some fun and interesting facts about food, and I had fun creating some trick questions to throw off the user. 
I set the timer to 15 and added time everytime the user answered. There is a next question, pause and reset button. I put the pause to allow the user to quickly google a question if they wanted to or maybe come back to it at a later time. 
I provided a "Time is Up" alert in the timer box for the user. 
I used standard Jquery to write this quiz. I used some simple variable and functions to construct the questions and then added some "if else" statements to score the answers. The score is displayed at the end of the quiz as i.e. " 9/10 correct!". 
The styling of the page is very old school, but I love it. The way the content pops off the page is really cool and I hope anyone who uses it will enjoy it the content and find the styling fun! I hope you can learn something from my FOOD TRIVIA! Have fun and good luck to anyone who dares enter the world of PLANT BASED KNOWLEDGE!
